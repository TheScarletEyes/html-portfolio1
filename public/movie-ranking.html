<h1> The Best Animes according to Razia</h1>
 <h2> Top 5 GOATED Animes</h2>
 <hr>
 <h3> 1. Attack On Titan (AOT)</h3>
 <p>The way it is animated, the soundtrack, the characters, the story, the thrill and the suspense. All in one action-packed anime.<br>
    From the very beginning to the final moments, it consistently delivers a mind-blowing experience. <br>
    The plot is intricately woven, keeping you on the edge of your seat with its twists and turns. This is a fictional masterpiece.</p>
<h3>2. Psycho pass</h3>
<p>This is a truly mature anime. Not because of excessive gore, violence, or sexuality, but because it handles mature themes and complicated ideas.<br>
    I consider it to be a particularly high-quality anime. If you love intense story lines, intense cliff hangers and animes that go into the most diabolical and psychotic places of the human mind then psycho pass is the anime for you.</p>
<h3>3. Vinland saga</h3>
<p>In a world where stories and writing are getting more shallow, Vinland Saga goes deep into character development, themes, and the exploration of humanity.<br>
    A very well made anime with excellent character development and pacing of the storie’s plot. It is an adult drama.</p>
<h3>4. HunterXHunter (HXH)</h3>
<p>When you watch until the end, you will realised it’s not a ‘normal’ casual shonen…. It’s full of hidden meanings and its very sad, because there’s no continuation of it.
</p>
<h3>5. Steins Gate</h3>
<p>It has one of the most compelling story arcs of any anime I've seen. The early episodes are interesting but not exceptionally so, with an unstable protagonist.<br>With the characters all steeped in otaku culture, they are relatable without being reduced to stereotypes. </p
